Repository for the paper "Please avoid the standardized alpha". Contains the
code required to reproduce all arXiv versions of the paper.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width='750px', dpi=200)
```

## Overview
The paper itself is in the `paper` folder. Figures and Latex code generated by
`R` are in the `chunks` folder. The `R` folder contains functions used in the 
paper or in the development of the paper. The folder `code` contains the code
used to generate the paper's figures, simulations, and so on. 

Some of the functions in this package could be of independent interest, but I 
will not make it a `CRAN` package. Of course, feel free to grab the code here
for your own projects. 

## Installation
From inside `R`, use one of the following commands:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/standardized")
```

The package needs to installed if you intend intend to run files in the `code`
directory.

## Usage Example
Run `run.R` from inside of `R` to repopulate the `chunks` directory.
