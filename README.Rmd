Joint repository for the unfinished paper "Please avoid the standardized alpha" 
and its companion `R` package. 

**N.B.** This repository will be split in two in the future; one package
for the paper and one for the `R` package.

```

## Overview

### Package
The package contains functions to estimate many different sorts of reliabiltiy
coefficients. The new ordinal reliability is in implemented
in the functions `ordinal_poly` (for estimation), `ordinal_omega` (population 
value) and `ordinal_alpha` (the coefficient alpha variant.)

### Paper
The paper itself is in the `paper` folder. Figures and Latex code generated by
`R` are in the `chunks` folder. The `R` folder contains functions used in the 
paper or in the development of the paper. The folder `code` contains the code
used to generate the paper's figures, simulations, and so on. 

Some of the functions in this package could be of independent interest, but I 
will not make it a `CRAN` package. Of course, feel free to grab the code here
for your own projects. 

## Installation
From inside `R`, use one of the following commands:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/standardized")
```

The package needs to installed if you intend intend to run files in the `code`
directory.

## Usage Example
Run `run.R` from inside of `R` to repopulate the `chunks` directory.
