Joint repository for the unfinished paper "Please avoid the standardized alpha" 
and its companion `R` package. The paper itself is unfinished but should be
preprint-ready soon, as by 15 March 2020.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width='750px', dpi=200)
```

## Overview

### Package
The package contains functions to estimate many different sorts of reliabiltiy
coefficients. The new ordinal reliabilities are implemented in a separate 
package, [conogive](https://github.com/JonasMoss/conogive).

### Paper
The paper itself is in the `paper` folder. Figures and Latex code generated by
`R` are in the `chunks` folder. The `R` folder contains functions used in the 
paper or in the development of the paper. The folder `code` contains the code
used to generate the paper's figures, simulations, and so on. 

Some of the functions in this package could be of independent interest, but I 
will not make it a `CRAN` package. Of course, feel free to grab the code here
for your own projects. 

## Installation
From inside `R`, use the following commands:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/standardized")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/conogive")
```

These packages needs to installed if you intend intend to run files in the `code`
directory.

## Usage Example
Run `run.R` from inside of `code` to repopulate the `chunks` directory.

## How to Contribute
I'm planning on being the lone author on this paper. Right now I don't 
welcome contributions.
